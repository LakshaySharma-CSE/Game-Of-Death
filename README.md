## 📖 About

**Game of Death** is a psychological, terminal-based Python game designed to test both your logic skills and your nerves.  
The game features **4 progressive levels**, starting from simple number-guessing challenges and ending with a high-intensity **Windows-only simulation** that mimics a system corruption error.

This project blends:
- 🎯 Logical challenges (numbers, floats, words)
- 🎮 Old-school command-line gameplay
- 😈 Psychological horror elements in the final stage

While **Levels 1–3** are safe for all platforms, **Level 4** is intentionally built to create tension and fear without causing any real harm.  
It’s recommended to experience the final level on a **virtual machine** or after making a system backup for maximum safety and immersion.

This game is not just about winning — it’s about how you react under pressure.
